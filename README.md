 BSI Project - CHALLENGE BSI 2020
 
 This challenge focuses on studying and transforming the real data that has been pro- vided to us by whatever means possible. In many organizations, staff members travel for work. They travel to customers, to conferences or to project meetings and these travels are sometimes expensive. As an employee of an organization, you do not have to pay for your own travel expenses, but the company takes care of them.
 
 * In this project, I conducted analyses on several aspects. First, I tried to figure out what **the most common variants** were (also helping me with Disco) and patterns to help me and to analyze the log workflow. Here I found that some requests take a long time to complete. Also, the average time is not high and there is not a big difference between different trip types. One solution I have come up with to decrease the **wasted time** may be to decrease the steps within an event, so as to standardize the process making it smoother and faster. Also alerts are essential to ensure that the process goes on.
 
* The second analysis I did is on the **money lost**. As you can see in the report, I found that many claims are paid multiple times, causing the organization to lose a lot of money. So you need software that keeps this information up to date so that it is no longer allowed.

* Last Analysis is about creating a **predictive model** to estimate whether a trip will need new logs. It is not super accurate, but with more data and perhaps a more complex learning method for regression we can achieve good results.
